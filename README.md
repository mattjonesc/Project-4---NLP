# Project 4 - NLP

The goal of the project is to make an API call to MeaningCloud to run sentiment analysis on a URL provided by the user.  I've set this up to run on localhost port 7000 for production.  The form accepts either a valid URL or text.  If the form detects and invalid URL, it will be processed as a text string.  The resulting polarity score, subjectivity and a text snippit from the URL will be returned from the API and displayed on the webpage.
